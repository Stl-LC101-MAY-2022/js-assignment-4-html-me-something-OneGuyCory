               I think the first tattoo you get is always a special one. 
               You learn if you love it or hate, if its your first or your last. 
               For me an instant love was born, not just for my own tattoos but for others and 
               the actual art behind them too. Wanted to go in nice and easy for my first one so
               one day while just driving around my wife and I decided to just go get little finger
               tattoos on our ring fingers. We both liked Superman so we decided on little Superman symbols.
               Positives were it was quick and small for a first one, negatives were it hurt a lot more than
               I thought it would. Especially for such a small area and design.

               My second tattoo I decided, &quot; First one went great, time to get something much bigger &quot;
               This one was also a little special to me as it was based off of design I actually drew on my own.
               My tattoo artist at that time was great to work with as well in regards to it, as he was willing
               to take my design and make it work as a tattoo. This was also the first tattoo that became a "conversation starter". 
               People would ask about it, want to see it, and helped make me a little bit more social and helped
               ease some anxiety I had about starting conversations with people. It was also this tattoo where I 
               learned about multi visit work. As I had two different appointments to finish it, one to do the
               outline and then one more to go in and color it.
