               I think the first tattoo you get is always a special one. 
               You learn if you love it or hate, if its your first or your last. 
               For me an instant love was born, not just for my own tattoos but for others and 
               the actual art behind them too. Wanted to go in nice and easy for my first one so
               one day while just driving around my wife and I decided to just go get little finger
               tattoos on our ring fingers. We both liked Superman so we decided on little Superman symbols.
               Positives were it was quick and small for a first one, negatives were it hurt a lot more than
               I thought it would. Especially for such a small area and design.

               My second tattoo I decided, &quot; First one went great, time to get something much bigger &quot;
               This one was also a little special to me as it was based off of design I actually drew on my own.
               My tattoo artist at that time was great to work with as well in regards to it, as he was willing
               to take my design and make it work as a tattoo. This was also the first tattoo that became a "conversation starter". 
               People would ask about it, want to see it, and helped make me a little bit more social and helped
               ease some anxiety I had about starting conversations with people. It was also this tattoo where I 
               learned about multi visit work. As I had two different appointments to finish it, one to do the
               outline and then one more to go in and color it.

            <p>This brings us to the biggest project to date, and my favorite so far. This idea came
               to me based off one of my favorite video game series, and one that helped me work through
               some issues when it came out. For this tattoo I also found a 
               new artist, who ive meshed really well with. It is still ongoing, with one to two sessions left. Currently
               though it is made up of a few elements that were all important to the game itself or parts
               that I personally liked a lot. This being one cohesive, planned piece is a big reason why this 
               is my most liked tattoo. I also learned a lot of patience doing this as ive had multiple, long,
               sometimes painful sessions. Just like the previous ones I have gotte, this also just hammered home 
               that I want to get more and that I really enjoy everything behind tattoos. During these I was
               also introduced to the pain of white highlights, which is a new brand of pain I hadn't experienced
               before. That is the process of going over areas at the end of a tattoo session with white ink 
               for small highlights in areas.

            <h2>Where To Go From Here?</h2>
            <p>I still need to finish the tattoos in progress. But I do have some idea going forward for more
               that I want. The two biggest things to figure out being, where to get my next tattoo, and which
               idea I want to do first. The leading idea right now is a space themed piece or sleeve, as space
               is probably one of the things im most interested in. The next piece after that is probably some
               kind of memorial piece for my dad who passed, but I have no clue what I want to get for that so
               it'll probably be awhile before I get that done. Location wise, my other arm is the top spot currently.
               The only downside to that is that it does have one tattoo there already. So my backup spot is 
               one of my legs, as its a big area and there isnt any other pieces there already. I can say for
               certain though, I see a lot more tattoos getting done in my future.
